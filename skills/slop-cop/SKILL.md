name: slop-cop
description: >-
  Runs the slop-cop taste linter, which answers copywriting, typography, interaction and motion rules from mblode/agent-skills and taste-training with TypeSafe Jev probabilities plus mechanical checks, and reads its scorecard, bands and calibration. Use when asked to "lint the copy", "check the typography in the code", "run slop-cop", or to measure how a rewrite changed the scorecard. For fixing the wording use copywriting; for a full type system review use typography-audit.

# slop-cop

Is: the operator's guide to `slop-cop`, an npm CLI that turns copywriting, typography, interaction and motion rules from `mblode/agent-skills` and `mblode/taste-training` into checks over Markdown, MDX, TSX and rendered pages. Mechanical where a regex or a real value decides; a calibrated probability from TypeSafe Jev where a judgement is needed.

Is not: the rules themselves (those live in `data/rules` and `src/rules/code` inside the package and trace back to the skill or lesson they came from), a copy rewriter, or a replacement for the `typography-audit` and `ui-design` audits.

## Commands

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `slop-cop lint <paths> --dry-run` | Count units, requests and estimated cost. No calls. Run this first. |
| `slop-cop lint <paths>` | Full run. Needs `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` or `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. Writes `results/lint-*.json` and caches answers under `results/cache`. |
| `slop-cop lint <paths> --mechanical-only` | Regex and value checks only. No key needed. |
| `slop-cop lint <paths> --output sarif` | SARIF 2.1.0 for code scanning. `--output json` for scripts. |
| `slop-cop lint --url <url>` | Computed styles through style-capture and a local Chromium. `--capture file.json` for a saved capture. |
| `slop-cop extract <paths>` | Print the units that would be judged, as JSONL. |
| `slop-cop rules list` and `rules check` | Inspect and validate the shipped rules. |
| `slop-cop eval` and `tune` | Precision, recall and calibration per rule on the labelled corpus; threshold tuning writes `data/rules/tuning.json` only with `--write`. |

Requires Node 24. Jev calls cost $0.042 per million input tokens; the summary line prints the actual cost after every run.

## Reading a finding

Every finding carries two independent facts. **Severity** (major, minor) says how bad it is if real and comes from the rule. **Band** says how sure the tool is: `act` (a mechanical hit, or Jev at or above the rule's act threshold; fails the run), `review` (between the review and act thresholds, or any hit from a `review-only` rule; printed with a `?` and never fails the run), and silent. Never downgrade a severity because the band is `review`; the uncertainty is already visible in the band.

`unknown` is a third outcome, not a pass: a rule could not decide because a value was unresolved (a Tailwind theme token, a missing class list) or a precondition was unmet. `--verbose` lists them.

## Workflow

1. Run `--dry-run` and quote the request count and cost.
2. Run the lint. Fix `act` findings in the copy or the classes, not by editing the rule.
3. Re-run only the files you touched; cached answers make the rest free.
4. Quote the scorecard delta by category in your summary.
5. A wrong finding is corpus evidence. Add the unit to the corpus with the correct label rather than lowering a threshold by hand; `tune` decides thresholds.

## Gotchas

- Projects that curl quotes at build time (remark-smartypants) are detected from `next.config.*`; the straight-quote rule then skips Markdown and still checks JSX. Force it with `"smartQuotesAtBuild"` in `slop-cop.config.json`.
- Deliberately bad copy (course stimuli, `Incorrect` examples, sample text) is corpus, not a lint target. Exclude it with `--exclude` or `slop-cop.config.json`, or suppress with `slop-cop-ignore: <rule-id>` on the line above. `ui-audit-ignore:<id>` from `ui-design` is honoured for ported rules.
- Most of the pack is `review-only`: ported patterns until someone has watched them on a real codebase, Jev rules until `tune --write` promotes them on labelled data. Their findings print with a `?` and never fail the run.
- Class-list rules see only static Tailwind classes. Computed values, template expressions and theme tokens are `unknown` until you run `--url`.
- Jev cannot count or compare numbers, so every threshold lives in a code rule; a rule that asks Jev "how many" is a bug.
- Never paste raw provider responses into an issue; the tool records categories and token counts only.
